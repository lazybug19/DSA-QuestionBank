Problem G
Difficulty: Medium
Original problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/fair-distribution-of-cookies/

Since the constraints are small, the solution
can be found by bruteforcing. Recursively try
out all the possible distributions to find the
one with minimum unfairness. There are n buckets
and k people, so each of the n buckets can have
k different assignments. Therefore, the total
number of possible distributions is k^n. We can
keep track of the unfairness of a distribution
as we recurse so that we can update the minimum
unfairness in O(1).

Overall time complexity: O(k^n).
