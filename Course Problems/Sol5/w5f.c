Problem F
Difficulty: Easy
Original problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-xor-of-all-pairings/

We have to essentially find
(A[0]^B[0]^A[0]^B[1]^ ... ^A[0]^B[m-1])^
(A[1]^B[0]^A[1]^B[1]^ ... ^A[1]^B[m-1])^
...
(A[n-1]^B[0]^A[n-1]^B[1]^ ... ^A[n-1]^B[m-1])

[Here, ^ = XOR operation]

XORing a number x with itself yields 0, extending
that we can XOR a number with itself an even number
of times to get 0. Consequently we can XOR a number
with itself an odd number of times to get the number
itself.

For all 0 <= i < n, A[i] occurs m times in the expression
For all 0 <= i < m, B[i] occurs n times in the expression

So we can check the parity of n and m and then
iterate through A and/or B accordingly to find
the answer.

Overall time complexity: O(n+m).
