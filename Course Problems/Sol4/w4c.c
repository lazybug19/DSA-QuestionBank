Problem C
Difficulty: Medium
Original Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/

The number of zeros in x! are same as the highest power of 5 in x!.
This is given by the following formula:
floor(x / 5) + floor(x / (5^2)) + floor(x / (5^3)) + ...
The number of terms in this formula will be log5(x).

So, the number of trailing zeros in factorial of i-th element 
of the array can be found in O(log(a[i])).
Number of trailing zeros in the factorials of all the elements 
of the array can be found in O(n * log(max(a[i]))).

We can store the frequency of each count of trailing zeros in 
an array. If there are k elements with p zeros trailing zeros 
in their factorial, we can form kC2 = k*(k-1)/2 good pairs.
p can take values from 0... max(a[i]), so finding number of 
good pairs given the frequency array can be done in O(max(a[i])).

Overall time complexity is O(nlog(max(a[i])) + max(a[i])).
