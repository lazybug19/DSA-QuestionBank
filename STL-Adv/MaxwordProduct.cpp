/*Maximum Product of Word Lengths
Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example 1:
Given ["abcw", "baz", "foo", "bar", "xtfn", "abcdef"]
Return 16
The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".

Example 2:
Given ["a", "ab", "abc", "d", "cd", "bcd", "abcd"]
Return 4
The two words can be "ab", "cd".

Example 3:
Given ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"]
Return 0
No such pair of words.

Solution
Since we are going to use the length of the word very frequently and we are to compare the letters of two words checking whether they have some letters in common:

using an array of int to pre-store the length of each word reducing the frequently measuring process;
since int has 4 bytes, a 32-bit type, and there are only 26 different letters, so we can just use one bit to indicate the existence of the letter in a word.*/
